# README

This is a project template for an Agile Scrum project.

## Getting Started

  1. Start off by customizing your [Project Home Page](docs/index.md). This will be your project one-pager.

  2. Customize your [Project Scope Page](docs/scope.md).

  3. Some initial content are provided here on [Agile Scrum Events or Processes](docs/team-processes.md) and [Working Agreements](docs/working-agreements.md). You can refine them as you go.

  4. For each iteration

      * Create a Sprint Info page under the ```sprints``` folder using this [template](docs/sprints/sprint-info-template.md).
      * Add a link to the page in [Sprints](docs/sprints.md).
      * Update the [Sprint Data Page](docs/sprint-data.md).


  5. As needed, create corresponding files or folders for the following:

      * Design
      * Development
      * Testing
      * Deployment
      * Operations
